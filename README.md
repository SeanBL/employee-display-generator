 ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build an application in Javascript that could allow users to generate a team profile in an html document along with a css file. The user is able to achieve this by using the command prompt and answering questions about each employee given in the command prompt. The motivation behind this project was to be able to create useful files quickly using backend programs such as node.js and libraries such as inquirer and jest. This project has helped me to learn how to structure files into separate directories and how to test my classes once I've completed them.
